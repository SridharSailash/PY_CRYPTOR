PY_CRYPTOR

In this question basically we needed to decompile a python code because chal.pyc was compiked and not readable.
i then used an online decompiler i found on the web.
then i had to modify a python code which i did with the help of chatgpt.
because we have the passkey but the code is reversed.
than i finally reversed it using chatgpt and compiled it to successfully. and run the code to get the flag
question was very tuff and i had to take a lot of help.
